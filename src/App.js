            I am an enthusiastic Mid Level Software Engineer with a passion for challenging myself and striving for excellence. 
            I leverage my skills in <strong>C#, .NET Core, ASP.NET, and Azure</strong> to deliver high-quality, scalable software solutions.

            Throughout my professional journey and personal projects, I've gained hands-on experience in delivering robust software solutions. 
            This has allowed me to develop strong proficiency in the <strong>.NET ecosystem (including .NET Core and ASP.NET Core for building APIs and applications)</strong>, 
            cloud platforms like <strong>Azure (leveraging services such as Azure DevOps, App Services, and Functions)</strong>, 
            and various JavaScript frameworks for frontend development. 
            I place a strong emphasis on writing clean, testable code (utilizing <strong>NUnit and Moq</strong>) and ensuring software reliability. 
            Collaboration is key to my approach; working within <strong>Agile teams using Scrum and Kanban</strong>, 
            I've contributed to successful project completions.
